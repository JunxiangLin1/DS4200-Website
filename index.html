                Tetris is one of those rare games that's both incredibly simple and endlessly addictive. Created by Russian engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984, it’s a puzzle game where players fit falling shapes, called tetrominoes, into neat rows. When you manage to fill a row, it clears away, giving you more space to work with. But as you keep going, the game speeds up, so it’s a constant race to keep the screen clear before everything piles to the top.
                What makes Tetris so compelling is its perfect balance of challenge and fun. It seems easy at first, but the rising speed and need to think ahead keep you glued to the screen, stacking and rotating pieces as fast as you can. It’s also more than just a game: researchers have found that playing Tetris can actually help improve things like spatial awareness and problem-solving skills.
                The game is so addicting, there is even a phenomenon called the tetris effect, where players see falling tetrominoes when their eyes are closed. 
                Over the years, Tetris has shown up on just about every gaming device you can think of, and its music and visuals have even made their way into pop culture. For a game built on such a simple concept, it’s amazing how Tetris has stayed relevant and beloved for decades.</p>
